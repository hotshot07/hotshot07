Hi! I'm Mayank Arora *(hotshot07)* 

I'm a programmer and a tennis player, will be starting my 4th year of computer engineering at Trinity College, Dublin this September.

Free book recommendation to whoever guesses what my favourite programming language is :D

*** 

I spent the last couple of months making it easy for people to learn to sort lists ahahaha, basically made Algovis, a python library for visualizing and analyzing algorithms. It has a very easy to use API and you can get started in just 6 lines of code :)

```python
from algovis import sorting
import random
my_list = [i+1 for i in range(1000)]
random.shuffle(my_list)
bs_object = sorting.BubbleSort(my_list)
bs_object.visualize(reverse = True, interval = 50)
```
